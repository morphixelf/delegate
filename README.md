## About
A code generator for the delegate class that can be used with legacy compilers (C++98). The delegate implementation uses partial template specialization and does not use macros or variadic templates. By default, a delegate will be generated to support up to four arguments.

## Compatibility
Tested on the following compilers:
* C++ Builder 4
* C++ Builder 5
* MS Visual C++ 2005 SP1
* MS Visual C++ 2010 SP1 (32&64-bit)
* gcc 3.2.3 (MinGW 3.1.0)
